You: Hi
Bot: Hi. This is not my first time posting something like this, and I'm sure it will be one of many that you guys have asked for!
I hope everyone has a great weekend!!!
You: Thank you how are you
Bot: Thank you how are you doing?"
"I'm fine." The man shook his head. "But I didn't see your face, did they? You're not the one who had to be there when it happened!" He went on: "'
You: Tell me the story
Bot: Tell me the story behind your decision to publish. I think it's important for all of us, especially those who want a more nuanced and informed account in order not only get our journalism but also help others understand what is happening around them."
